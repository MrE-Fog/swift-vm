# swift-vm
An email server (www.isellemails.com) with little configuration.

You can either choose the VM or the raspberry pi image.

This email server is dovecot, postfix, postfixadmin, roundcubemail, letsencrypt, fail2ban, and rspamd.

Email servers are complicated in the sense that there isn't one executable, but instead, multiple executables. The configuration between the executables takes experience. That's why I'm sharing this.

Swift VM comes preconfigured. It is meant to be easy to install, cloned, and executed on multiple platforms.

Platforms supported:
x86, amd64, x86_64, and raspberry pi
